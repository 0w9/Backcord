# Backcord
This bot allows owners of discord guilds to create a backup of their server. In case of an hack/ termination, the users can easily be added again!

## How does this work?

### User-side
Discord gives bot developers the oportunity to ask for given permissions on a users account. For example, this can happen on an website. With Backcord every user that would like to verify would have to click a website link and authenticate with the bot. The bot will ask them for permissions, such as "adding you to guilds". When they agree, you now have an backup of the user.

### Admin-side

Every person that added the bot to their guild, can create an account on the Backcord website. In case their account is lost, they can login on the admin panel of Backcord and add all of their members to a new discord guild. Also, they can set the new discord account as admin there (to control the bot).
